# Project4615--Minimalism
This features the first game in my 4615 Project series, this one featuring 2d platformer gameplay based on an idea when considering a Minimalism game jam

The core design elements are:
<ul>
  <li>2d platformer</li>
  <li>Unity game engine</li>
  <li>Simple graphics</li>
  <li>A movement + combat system as one</li>
  <li>Actually completing a project, start to finish</li>
</ul>

This game was created with Unity version 2020.2.1f1. To launch the game in the editor, open the MainScene and press play. 

To download and play the game, visit the itch.io page HERE (Not yet finished).
