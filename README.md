# Project4615--Minimalism
This features the first game in my 4615 Project series, this one featuring 2d platformer gameplay based on an idea when considering a Minimalism game jam

The core design elements are:
<ul>
  <li>2d platformer</li>
  <li>Unity game engine</li>
  <li>Simple graphics</li>
  <li>A movement + combat system as one</li>
  <li>Actually completing a project, start to finish</li>
</ul>

To download and play the game, visit the itch.io page HERE (Not yet finished).
